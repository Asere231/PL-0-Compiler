# PL-0-Compiler

This project is a complete compiler for the PL/0 programming language, built over a sequence of assignments for a compiler construction course. The project is organized into four main folders: `HW1`, `HW2`, `HW3`, and `HW4Compiler`. Each stage builds upon the last, culminating in a fully working compiler.

## üìÅ Project Structure

- **HW1** ‚Äì *Lexical Analyzer*:  
  Implements the scanner responsible for tokenizing source code into a stream of tokens.

- **HW2** ‚Äì *Parser*:  
  Constructs the recursive descent parser for PL/0 and begins semantic checks.

- **HW3** ‚Äì *Code Generator*:  
  Adds code generation logic that produces intermediate code to be executed on a virtual machine.

- **HW4Compiler** ‚Äì *Final Compiler*:  
  Integrates all previous components and includes a full virtual machine that executes the generated code.
