The PM/0 virtual machine (VM) is a stack-based computer simulating a simple 
assembly-like language. It executes a set of instructions stored in memory and manages 
a stack to perform arithmetic, and logical operations, providing a platform for 
understanding fundamental concepts of computer architecture and programming.

Source code: vm.c
Input file: ELF.txt
Output file: HW1_output.txt  (to compare output if needed)

How to run this program:

first, compile --> gcc vm.c
second, run with file input --> ./a.out ELF.txt
third and last, the program will ask for an input (a number).
